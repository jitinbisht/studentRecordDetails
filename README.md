### Student Details Project

- It allows you to add a new record of a student with his/her Name and Marks
- If the marks entered is below 33, the row for that particular record is highlighted with red.
- The user is shown with a list of 3 records on page load.
- The user is shown with the list of records along with the facility to 'Edit' and 'Delete' the particular record.
- It has a Student Summary section which shows Minimum marks, Maximum Marks and Average Marks calculated from the list of the records.
- Once the user edit any single record, it shows a modal with the data to update. Once the new data is saved, the list is updated with the new data. Hence the Student Summary section is also updated with the new record data.
